I'm a Senior Engineering Manager at [Sentry](https://sentry.io), leading the teams behind Seer's AI Code Review and Source Code Management integrations. Previously I led Session Replay, bootstrapped Sentry's gaming team and launched [console support](https://blog.sentry.io/error-monitoring-and-crash-reporting-for-gaming-consoles/), and managed the Mobile SDK team. I joined Sentry relatively early — when the whole company was the size of today's SDK team — to build the [.NET SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet) after over a decade of writing C#. I still have a soft spot for working on open source projects like [NuGet Trends](https://nugettrends.com) and [Code Review Trends](https://codereviewtrends.com).
